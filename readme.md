# Day 10 of My Vue.js Challenge

This is the tenth day of my [Vue.js challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/vue-basic-challenge), building job listing app.

Unfortunately the AdView.online's feed API doesn't have an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so I've decided to use Express and Node to "proxy" the HTTP request via [my server](https://github.com/zsoltime/adview-wrapper).

##Â User Stories

- [x] I can see the latest jobs when I arrive to the site

- [x] I can see the job title, company, location and salary for the jobs listed
- [ ] I can save the jobs I like and get back to them later
